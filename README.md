# CarRacing-v2-gymnasium

This repository contains 3 different Deep Reinforcement Learning implementations for the CarRacing-v2 game from gymnasium:
* Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
* Dueling Deep Q-Learning (DDQN)
* Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

The Deep Learning Architecture is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
